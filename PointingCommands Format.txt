Line 1 is a single dummy character, necessary because of funny behavior in sscanf().

Line 2 is the integer number of pointing commands.

Each subsequent line is a comma-separated list of the following values (with no spaces):

Column 1 - integer index of the command, starting from 0 (not 1)
Column 2 - integer 1 indicates that the command at this time is active and should be executed, 0 means to ignore it
Column 3 - float target yaw value, positive is to the left
Column 4 - float target pitch value, positive is up
Column 5 - float target roll value, currently ignored because the Pixy can't handle it.
